# nba [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickb1080/nba.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickb1080/nba) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/nickb1080/nba/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/nickb1080/nba?branch=master)
*The NBA's stats API for the browser or Node*

`npm install nba`

## NBA API
The [stats.nba.com](http://stats.nba.com) uses a large number of undocumented JSON endpoints to provide the statistics tables and charts displayed on that website. This library provides a JavaScript client for interacting with many of those API endpoints.

## Getting Started

`NBA.findPlayer(str)` will return an object with a player's name, their ID, and their team information. This method is built into the package.

All methods in the `NBA.stats` namespace require an object to be passed in as a parameter. The keys to the object are in the docs for the `stats` namespace [here](doc/stats.md)

## Stability Warning
This is a client for an unstable and undocumented API. While I try to follow [semver](http://semver.org/) for changes to the JavaScript API this library exposes, the underlying HTTP API can (and has) changed without warning. In particular, the NBA has repeatedly deprecated endpoints, or added certain required headers without which requests will fail. Further, this library comes bundled with a (relatively) up-to-date list of current NBA players which is subject to change at any time -- the specific contents of it should not be considered part of this library's API contract.

## Usability
To put it nicely, the NBA's API endpoints are a little clunky to work with. This library tries to strike a balance between being usable but not making assumptions about how the data will be used. Specifically, the NBA sends data in a concise "table" form where the column headers come first then each result is an array of values that need to be matched with the proper header. This library does a simple transformation to zip the header and values arrays into a header-keyed object. Beyond that, it tries to not do too much. This is important to note because sometimes the various "result sets" that come back on a single endpoint seem sort of arbitrary. The underlying HTTP API doesn't seem to follow standard REST practices; rather it seems the endpoints are tied directly to the data needed by specific tables and charts displayed on [stats.nba.com](). This is what I mean by "clunky" to work with -- it can be tricky to assemble the data you need for a specific analysis from the various endpoints available.

## Documentation
There are four primary parts of this library
- *Top-level methods*
- *`stats` namespace* &mdash; [docs](https://github.com/nickb1080/nba/blob/master/doc/stats.md)
- *`sportVu` namespace*
- *`synergy` namespace*

## "I don't use Node.js"
Please take a look at [nba-client-template](http://github.com/nickb1080/nba-client-template). The relevant part of the repo is a single JSON document from which many programming languages can dynamically generate an API client. The repo contains (sloppy) examples in [Ruby](https://github.com/nickb1080/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.rb) and [Python](https://github.com/nickb1080/nba-client-template/blob/master/example-clients/simple-client.py). Compiled languages can use code generation techniques to the same effect -- there's a (again, sloppy) example in [Go](https://github.com/nickb1080/nba-client-template/tree/master/example-clients/golang). If you'd like me to publish it to a specific registry so you can install it with your language's package manager, please [open an issue](http://github.com/nickb1080/nba-client-template/issues). Please note, however, that package only includes  the endpoints exposed by this library under the `stats` namespace -- `sportvu` and `synergy` endpoints aren't yet included in it. I also plan to add a command-line interface to this library so that it can be easily driven as a child process by another program.
